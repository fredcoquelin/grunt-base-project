# grunt-base-project

Base frontend project made with Grunt with a started pack for SCSS and JS files.
You'll find all you need to start a simple frontend project based on HTML, CSS & JS.

It is a proposal to organize the files on both SCSS and JS.

Any comments and discussions will be welcome to improve this project.

Here is what the project includes in a few points :
* Grunt config for SCSS and JS file
* Files architecture
* Simple sprite generator based on grunt-spritesmith
* Browserify configuration
* JS concatenation
* JS and images minification
* PostCSS configuration
* Files copy to deploy your file to a release environment for example

And more to comeâ€¦
